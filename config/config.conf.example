# NAS Monitor Configuration File
# Power-aware network storage monitoring for Linux laptops
#
# Edit this file to match your network and NAS setup.
# After making changes, restart the service:
#   systemctl --user restart nas-monitor.service

[networks]
# Comma-separated list of home network SSIDs
# Include an empty string for wired connections
# Examples:
#   home_networks=MyWiFi,MyWiFi-5GHz,
#   home_networks=Home-Network,Guest-Network
home_networks=Your-Home-WiFi,Your-Home-5G,

[nas_devices]
# List your NAS devices in the format: hostname/share
# One device per line, no quotes needed
# Examples:
#   my-nas.local/home
#   backup-server.local/backups
#   192.168.1.100/media
#   synology-ds920.local/documents

# Add your NAS devices below:
# my-nas.local/home
# backup-nas.local/media

[intervals]
# Check intervals in seconds based on power source and network location
# Lower values = more responsive, higher battery usage
# Higher values = better battery life, less responsive

# When connected to home network on AC power
home_ac_interval=15

# When connected to home network on battery
home_battery_interval=60

# When connected to other networks on AC power
away_ac_interval=180

# When connected to other networks on battery
away_battery_interval=600

[behavior]
# Maximum failed connection attempts before backing off
# Higher values = more persistent, lower values = fail faster
max_failed_attempts=3

# Minimum battery level (%) to attempt network operations
# Below this level, all network activity is suspended
min_battery_level=10

# Enable desktop notifications for mount/unmount events
# true = show notifications, false = silent operation
enable_notifications=true

# Advanced Settings (uncomment to modify)
# =========================================

# Timeout for network connectivity checks (seconds)
# network_timeout=3

# Log level: debug, info, warning, error
# log_level=info

# Maximum log file size (MB)
# max_log_size=10

# Example configurations for common scenarios:
# ============================================

# Home office setup with reliable power:
# home_ac_interval=10
# home_battery_interval=30
# away_ac_interval=120
# away_battery_interval=300

# Mobile user with frequent travel:
# home_ac_interval=20
# home_battery_interval=120
# away_ac_interval=300
# away_battery_interval=900
# min_battery_level=15

# Power-conscious setup for maximum battery life:
# home_ac_interval=30
# home_battery_interval=180
# away_ac_interval=600
# away_battery_interval=1800
# min_battery_level=20
